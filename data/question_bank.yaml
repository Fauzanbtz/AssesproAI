    1: Very minimal, vague, or unclear description with little technical relevance.
    2: 'Gives a general mention of CNN or TensorFlow with limited detail about the

      full process of building and training the model.'

    4: "Provides a detailed, step-by-step description of building a CNN in TensorFlow\n\
      \    for image classification, covering data preprocessing, key CNN layers,\
      \ model\n     compilation, training, and evaluation. The explanation is clear,\
      \ logically ordered,\n shows strong understanding of the full workflow."

    context: "context: This question is about the candidate's understanding of the\
      \ end-to-end workflow of building a CNN in TensorFlow specifically for image\
      \ classification tasks. Answers that only explain CNNs in theory without mentioning\
      \ TensorFlow\n workflow or practical steps are weaker."
    hard_constraints: "Explicitly mention building a CNN using TensorFlow / Keras.\
      \ - Cover the main stages: data   preprocessing, defining CNN layers, compiling,\
      \ and training. - Make it clear that the task is image classification (not some\
      \ unrelated use case).\n\n  If the answer is very high-level theory about CNNs\
      \ without TensorFlow-specific\n steps, or does not clearly describe an image\
      \ classification workflow, you MUST\nlimit the score to a maximum of 2.'"
