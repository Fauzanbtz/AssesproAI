      This question must be evaluated specifically within the context of the Dev Certification Machine Learning (DCML).
      Answers that discuss unrelated jobs, other certifications, general ML experience, or external projects—without
      connecting them to the DCML certification—should not receive a high score.

    hard_constraints: >
      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the candidate MUST:
      - Clearly refer to the DCML certification context.
      - Describe ONE concrete challenge that occurred DURING the certification.
      - Provide a clear explanation of HOW the issue was resolved (debugging, TensorFlow techniques, tooling, etc.).
      
      If the answer is well-written but mostly unrelated to the DCML certification,
      you MUST limit the score to a maximum of 2 regardless of fluency or technical depth.

      This question is specifically about the candidate's real, personal experience using transfer learning
      in TensorFlow on actual projects. Answers that only define transfer learning in theory, or that describe
      generic machine learning experience without concrete TensorFlow project examples, should not receive
      a high score.

      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the answer MUST:
      - Explicitly mention transfer learning in TensorFlow.
      - Refer to at least one real project where transfer learning was applied.
      - Clearly explain what benefits transfer learning brought to that project
        (such as improved accuracy, reduced training time, or better generalization).

      If the answer is mostly theoretical, very generic, or not clearly tied to real TensorFlow projects,
      you MUST limit the score to a maximum of 2, even if the explanation sounds technically correct.

      This question focuses on whether the candidate understands dropout as a regularization technique
      in TensorFlow and can explain both how to implement it and why it is used.
      Answers that only say “dropout reduces overfitting” without explaining implementation details
      or the mechanism are weaker.

      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the answer MUST:
      - Mention the Dropout layer in TensorFlow / Keras (e.g. tf.keras.layers.Dropout or similar).

      or clear explanation of the effect, you MUST limit the score to a maximum of 2.
