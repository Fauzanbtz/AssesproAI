    en: "Can you share any specific challenges you faced while working on certification and how you overcame them?"
  languages_supported: ["en"]

  rubric:
    4: >
      Comprehensive and clear response. Candidate provides a detailed description of
      specific challenges encountered during certification, clearly explains how each
      challenge was overcome, demonstrates strong understanding of technical aspects
      and problem-solving skills, and reflects on the learning process in a structured,
      well-organized way.
    3: >
      Specific challenge with basic solution. Candidate describes at least one concrete
      challenge related to the certification (e.g., model building with TensorFlow) and
      explains how it was overcome, but the explanation may be brief, lack depth, or miss
      some technical details, although it still shows reasonable understanding.
    2: >
      General challenge mentioned without details. Candidate talks about difficulties
      in very general terms without clear context, specific examples, or a clear
      explanation of how the challenge was solved.
    1: >
      Minimal or vague response. Answer is very short, unclear, or only loosely related
      to the question, with almost no technical relevance.
    0: >
      Unanswered or completely unrelated answer.

  llm:
    context: >
      This question focuses on the candidate's experience during the certification process
      (e.g., Dev Certification in Machine Learning / DCML). The goal is to see how they
      handled real problems while working on the certification tasks or projects, not just
      generic stories about their career.
    hard_constraints: >
      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the answer must:
      - Clearly refer to challenges that happened DURING the certification process
        (not just any random project).
      - Describe at least one concrete technical or project challenge (e.g., model accuracy,
        debugging training code, data issues).
      - Explain how the challenge was solved, including tools or techniques (TensorFlow,
        debugging, hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, etc.).
      If the answer is well written but talks mainly about unrelated work or very generic
      difficulties without clear link to the certification, the score must be capped at 2.

      Comprehensive and very clear response. Candidate describes concrete personal
      experience using transfer learning in TensorFlow, gives specific project examples,
      mentions relevant architectures or pretrained models, and clearly explains how
      transfer learning improved the projects (e.g., better accuracy, faster training,
      handling limited data). The answer is well organized and shows strong conceptual
      understanding and practical application.
    3: >
      Specific experience with basic explanation. Candidate describes experience using
      transfer learning in TensorFlow and mentions at least one project or use case.
      They explain the benefits in general terms (e.g., helped performance or reduced
      training time) but with limited depth or missing some details.
    2: >
      General response with limited details. Candidate mentions transfer learning or
      TensorFlow only in a high-level way, without concrete project examples or clear
      explanation of actual benefits.
    1: >
      Minimal or vague response. Explanation is very short, confused, or not clearly
      connected to transfer learning in TensorFlow.
    0: >
      Unanswered or completely unrelated answer.

  llm:
    context: >
      This question is specifically about the candidate's hands-on experience applying
      transfer learning in TensorFlow projects (for example, using pretrained CNNs for
      image classification). The focus is on how they used it in real work or certification
      projects and what concrete benefits it brought.
    hard_constraints: >
      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the answer must:
      - Explicitly mention transfer learning AND TensorFlow together.
      - Describe at least one specific project or use case where transfer learning
        was applied (e.g., image classification with a pretrained model).
      - Explain clear benefits (e.g., improved accuracy, faster convergence, better
        generalization with limited data).
      Answers that only define transfer learning without relating it to actual projects,
      or that mention TensorFlow only superficially, must be limited to a maximum score of 2.

    en: "Describe a complex TensorFlow model you have built and the steps you took to ensure its accuracy and efficiency."
  languages_supported: ["en"]

  rubric:
    4: >
      Comprehensive and very clear response. Candidate describes a genuinely complex
      TensorFlow model (e.g., deep CNN, multi-input model, or architecture used in a
      real project), including its purpose and main components. They clearly explain
      steps to ensure accuracy and efficiency, such as preprocessing, regularization
      (e.g., dropout), hyperparameter tuning, monitoring metrics, and optimization
      techniques (e.g., learning rate scheduling). Shows strong understanding of both
      modeling and performance considerations.
    3: >
      Specific model with basic explanation. Candidate describes a model built in
      TensorFlow with some architectural details and explains one or two steps taken
      to improve accuracy or efficiency (e.g., used dropout, tuned epochs), but the
      explanation lacks depth or misses several important aspects.
    2: >
      General response with limited details. Candidate mentions building a TensorFlow
      model but does not describe the architecture clearly and only vaguely refers to
      improving accuracy or efficiency.
    1: >
      Minimal or vague response. Answer is unclear, very short, or provides almost no
      technical explanation of the model or the steps taken.
    0: >
      Unanswered or completely unrelated answer.

  llm:
    context: >
      This question aims to assess the candidate's ability to design and reason about
      complex TensorFlow models, including how they think about architecture, accuracy,
      and computational efficiency in real projects.
    hard_constraints: >
      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the answer must:
      - Describe a specific TensorFlow model (not just "I used TensorFlow") including
        some architectural elements (e.g., CNN layers, dense layers, multi-input, etc.).
      - Mention concrete steps taken to improve accuracy and/or efficiency (e.g.,
        normalization, dropout, learning rate scheduling, callbacks, data preprocessing).
      - Show at least some understanding of why those steps help.
      If the answer is mostly generic (e.g., only says “I tuned hyperparameters”
      without any detail) or does not clearly describe the model, the score should not
      exceed 2.

  question_text:
    en: "Explain how to implement dropout in a TensorFlow model and the effect it has on training."
  languages_supported: ["en"]

  rubric:
    4: >
      Comprehensive and very clear response. Candidate explains how to implement
      dropout in TensorFlow (e.g., using tf.keras.layers.Dropout with a specific rate),
      describes that dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training, and clearly
      explains its role in preventing overfitting and improving generalization. They
      also mention its effect on training behavior (e.g., slower convergence, different
      train vs. inference behavior).
    3: >
      Specific explanation with basic understanding. Candidate mentions using a Dropout
      layer in TensorFlow and explains in general that it helps reduce overfitting,
      but the detail about how it works or its effects on training may be limited.
    2: >
      General response with limited details. Candidate mentions dropout and maybe
      TensorFlow, but does not clearly explain what dropout does or how it affects
      training and generalization.
    1: >
      Minimal or vague response. Explanation is very short, superficial, or technically
      incorrect.
    0: >
      Unanswered or completely unrelated answer.

  llm:
    context: >
      This question focuses on the candidate's conceptual and practical understanding
      of dropout in TensorFlow: how to implement it in code and how it affects model
      training and overfitting.
    hard_constraints: >
      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the answer must:
      - Mention the use of a Dropout layer in TensorFlow (e.g., tf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate)).
      - Explain that dropout randomly "turns off" (deactivates) some neurons during training.
      - Connect dropout to preventing overfitting and improving generalization.
      Answers that only say “dropout prevents overfitting” without any mention of how
      it is implemented or how it works internally should be capped at score 2.

  rubric:
    4: >
      Comprehensive and very clear response. Candidate provides a step-by-step description
      of building a CNN in TensorFlow for image classification, including data loading
      and preprocessing, defining CNN layers (e.g., Conv2D, activation such as ReLU,
      MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense), possibly using dropout, compiling the model (e.g.,
      optimizer and loss), training with validation, and evaluating performance. The
      answer is coherent and shows deep understanding.
    3: >
      Specific explanation with basic understanding. Candidate describes the main
      steps of building a CNN (e.g., some layers and training) but may miss some stages
      (like preprocessing, evaluation, or details of compilation) or only describe them
      briefly.
    2: >
      General response with limited details. Candidate talks about CNNs or TensorFlow
      in a very high-level way, without a clear sequence of steps or detailed mention
      of specific layers and training process.
    1: >
      Minimal or vague response. Answer is short, unclear, or does not demonstrate real
      understanding of how to build a CNN in TensorFlow.

  llm:
    context: >
      This question targets the candidate's practical understanding of how to build a
      CNN pipeline in TensorFlow for image classification, from data preprocessing to
      model architecture and training.
    hard_constraints: >
      To receive a score of 3 or 4, the answer must:
      - Describe multiple key steps in building a CNN with TensorFlow/Keras, including
        at least the model architecture (Conv2D, activation, pooling, Flatten, Dense)
        and the training/compilation process.
      - Make it clear that the context is image classification (e.g., classes, labels,
        input images).
      Answers that only define what a CNN is in theory, without a concrete TensorFlow
      process or that ignore image classification context, should be capped at score 2.
